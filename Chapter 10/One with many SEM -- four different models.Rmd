SPSS is taken from book's site. Results are identical to SPSS example in book's site and similar to p. 292

###Use fSRM syntax.  
Took the fSRM syntax and deleted all elements that do not pertain to mother as to create one-with-many-reciprocal design.  Note that *lavaan* issues a warning "variables (theta) is not positive definite".  Dyadic reciporcity correlation is not calculated (Inf).  Problems seems similar to problem encountered with *lme4*.  However, estimates are different from *lme4*.  Note that the variances of the observed variables is forced to be zero, and the variance is "transfered" to the error.

###Take the SPSS-compatible model and add intercepts. 
Constrain intercepts to equality with roles.  Note that the variance is now split between the observed variables (error in MLM?) and the residual (residual in MLM?).  The sums of va + vr and vp + vr are identical to the SPSS output.  The distribution of the variances differ from both *lme4* and *nlme*.

###Constrain the residuals of the focal person and partners to equality.
This model is the same as the above, but produces one estimate of residual.  This constraint lead to a gain of one df.  The  The number of parameters is identical to MLM in R.  The various parameters related to the error are not identical $\chi$^2^.
